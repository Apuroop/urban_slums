        <h3>Slums in the Big City: An Introduction</h3>
        <p>As a part of the 2001 Census, for the first time the total slum populations in large cities was recorded. This data was subsequently updated during the 2011 Census.</p>
        <p>In this project, we looked at the slum population data with respect to the total population data for India's 10 most populus cities.</p> 
        <p>The aim was to identify any trends between population and slum growth in these cities.</p>
        <p>The graph under the map is interactive and gives a quick perspecitve of how the Total Population has changed in these cities between 2001 and 2011</p>
        <p><strong><ul>
            <li>Violet Circle : City's Pop. (2001)</li> 
            <li>Blue Circle : City's Pop. (2011)</li></strong>
            </ul></strong>
        The idea is to give a quick idea about how much or little, the total population of a city has grown</p>

        <img src="mumbai.jpg" width="230" height="130"></a>
        <p>With close to 12 million residents, Mumbai remains one of India's most populus cities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slum Pop. (2011): 5.20 million</li>
            <li>Slum Pop. (2001): 5.82 million</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mumbai posits an interesting trend. While Mumbai's overall population rose by <strong>4.4%</strong> between 2001 and 2011, its slum population fell by nearly <strong>10.59%</strong> during the same time</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Chennai had the 3rd lowest population growth rate amongst the top 10 cities. At <strong>10.20%</strong> the population growth rate of Chennai is just more than double of Mumbai. However, despite this the total slum population in Chennai grew by about <strong>79.47%</strong></p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This report does not in any way provide any definitive reasons for why slum populations might be growing or falling with respect to the total population of cities.</p>
        <p>However, what we do hope is clearly highlighted is the fact that the trends for slum population levels and total popultion levels are <strong>not</strong> the same across various large cities. This potentially provides a compelling reason to delve deeper to find possible reasons for such variations in trends across all these cities</p>
        <p>It could be an interesting exercise to understand what led to a fall in slum levels across Mumbai, Delhi or Ahmedabad. Are these results of certain administrative policies or clever accounting gimics to hide the grim realities?</p>
        <p>All in all, this can serve as a spring board to find ideas to help deal with urban housing problems in India</p>
